.NET MVC AngularJS Sample Project

This project is a simple web application which calculates a life insurance estimate based on the formula:

Cover Amount Calculation = (Mortgage or Rent*12*20) + (no. of Children * 50,000) + Debt

And the following 3 questions:

1. Do you rent or pay mortgage?
2. Do you have children, if so how many?
3. How much outstanding debt do you have?

The project is built in .NET MVC, and includes Bootstrap CSS framework as well as the AngularJS framework.

Assumptions:
I have made the assumption that the users may need to enter both rental payments and mortgage value, and have allowed the calculation of both in my solution.
